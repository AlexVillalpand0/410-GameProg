Dot Product:
I implemented Dot Product to make the Gargoyles turn and face the player no matter what location

Linear Interpolation:
I implemented Linear interpolation to have the Ghosts turn 360 degrees and track the player even when they are moving through to waypoints.

Particle Effects:
I added "bubble-like" steam efffects originating from the base of the gargoyles, it was fun to see all the different parameters and ways to create and 
output the effects. I chose the dount parameter which created cool effects around the base of the gargoyles

We all decided to work independently for the tutorial and also teaming up for the scripts.

With use of given functions I created the Gargoyle Track script while we all collaborated on the Ghost Tracking one.
